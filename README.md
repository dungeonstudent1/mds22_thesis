 Foul lexicon detection with BERT variations. HSE MDS 2022.
 
 The .ipynb file contains dataset preparation and training pipeline for the three BERT variations.
 The train, val and test .csv files are generated in the .ipynb file, but for convenience they've been placed manually in ./data folder.
 The two initial .csv files are concatenated in the .ipynb file.
 All other files are checkpoints and weights resulting from training the best-performing model - RuConvBERT. 
 
 The three models and the last of the trained weights file were too heavy to upload on GitHub.
